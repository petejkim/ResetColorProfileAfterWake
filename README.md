# ResetColorProfileAfterWake

## Usage

1. [Download](https://github.com/petejkim/ResetColorProfileAfterWake/releases/download/1.1/ResetColorProfileAfterWake-1.1.zip)
the app and unzip the file. Alternatively, you can build the app from source
with Xcode.
2. Move `ResetColorProfileAfterWake` application to a directory of your choice,
for example `/Applications/Utilities`.
3. When running the app for the first time, right click on the app icon and
click Open instead of double-clicking it. Some warning will show when running
for the first time because this app is not signed (it costs $99 for me to be
able to do that). Click Open to continue. This app runs in the background and
nothing will show. You can use Activity Monitor if you want to verify that it
is running.
4. Verify that it works by making the computer go to sleep, and then waking it
back up.
5. To make the app run automatically, add the app to your macOS user's Login
Items. (System Preferences -> Users & Groups -> Login Items)
